# Enigma


self-assessment

Really wish I was able to get decrypt working in the command line but otherwise,
I am really happy with how far I was able to push this project.

UPDATE: I turned my computer (and brain) off for the night and when I took a crack at creating
decrypt today, I realize "oh my, I need to pass in the key and and date as arguments in the decrypt method"

Functionality - 3
Command line interface is fully implemented, as is encrypt and decrypt

Object Oriented Programming - 3
Project does include a module but not one that can be used outside of this project.
Multiple classes each with single responsibilities, only 2 methods are longer than 7 lines.
No class is longer than 100 lines (ok really none are longer than 50).
Variable and method names clearly communicate purpose

Test Driven Development - 4
All tests clearly communicate purpose
Multiple tests use mocks and stubs
Rake file with 100% coverage

Version Control - 3.5
62 commits
15 pull requests (maybe more if I can figure out decrypt runner!)
Commits do not include multiple pieces of functionality
Commits have clear messaging
